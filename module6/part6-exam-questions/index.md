## Question 1: Designated Agency in New Jersey

**Question**: 
Maria is a licensee at Horizon Realty. The broker of Horizon Realty appoints any licensee who brings in a brokerage agreement as the designated agent of that client. Maria obtains a listing agreement to sell David's house. He then asks Maria if she will also help him find a new house. She agrees, and David signs a buyer agency agreement. Maria is:

**Answer Choices**:
A. a designated buyer's agent only.
B. a designated seller's agent only.
C. a designated seller's agent and a designated buyer's agent.
D. a dual agent.

**Correct Answer**: C. a designated seller's agent and a designated buyer's agent.

**Detailed Explanation**:

**NJ Law Reference**: Under New Jersey law (N.J.A.C. 11:5-1.21), designated agency occurs when a broker assigns different licensees within the same brokerage to represent different parties in a transaction.

**Key Points**:
1. **Horizon Realty has two separate agreements** with David:
   - A listing agreement for selling his current house (seller representation)
   - A buyer agency agreement for finding a new house (buyer representation)

2. **Maria is designated for both roles**:
   - She is the designated seller's agent for the sale of David's current home
   - She is the designated buyer's agent for helping David purchase a new home

3. **Why this is NOT dual agency**:
   - Dual agency occurs when one agent represents both buyer AND seller in the **SAME transaction**
   - Here, these are two separate transactions
   - Maria represents David's interests in both transactions, not opposing parties

**NJ-Specific Considerations**:
- New Jersey requires clear disclosure of agency relationships
- The Consumer Information Statement must be provided at first substantive contact
- Designated agency must be properly documented in writing

**Memory Aid**: "Separate transactions, same client = designated agent for both. Same transaction, both sides = dual agency."

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to reveal answer and explanation</strong></summary>

**Correct Answer**: C. a granting clause.

**Detailed Explanation**:

**NJ Law Reference**: New Jersey Statute 46:4-1 outlines requirements for deeds.

**Essential Elements of a Valid Deed in NJ**:
1. **Granting Clause (Words of Conveyance)**: REQUIRED
   - Must contain words that transfer ownership
   - Examples: "grant," "convey," "bargain and sell"
   - This is the only element from the choices that is legally required

2. **NOT Required (but often included)**:
   - Recital of consideration: Shows purchase price, not required
   - Grantee's signature: Only grantor must sign
   - Habendum clause ("to have and to hold"): Traditional but not required

**Other Required Elements**:
- Competent grantor (legal capacity)
- Identifiable grantee (can be identified)
- Grantor's signature
- Property description (metes and bounds or lot/block)
- Delivery and acceptance
- Acknowledgement (for recording purposes)

**NJ-Specific Requirements**:
- Deeds must be in writing (Statute of Frauds)
- Must be properly acknowledged before recording
- Recording required for protection against subsequent purchasers

**Memory Aid**: "Granting words give the deed life. Consideration and habendum reduce strife, but aren't required to end the property's strife."

**Your Answer**: (Record your answer here before checking)

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to reveal answer and explanation</strong></summary>

**Correct Answer**: A. Exclusive agency listing agreement

**Detailed Explanation**:

**NJ Law Reference**: New Jersey recognizes various listing agreements under common law and commission rules.

**Types of Listing Agreements**:

1. **Exclusive Agency Listing**:
   - Broker receives commission if ANYONE sells the property EXCEPT the seller
   - Seller reserves right to sell property themselves without paying commission
   - **THIS IS THE CORRECT ANSWER** - Robert can sell to Thomas without paying Premier Properties

2. **Exclusive Right to Sell**:
   - Broker receives commission regardless of who sells the property
   - Even if seller finds their own buyer, broker still gets commission
   - Most common type used in NJ residential real estate

3. **Open Listing**:
   - Non-exclusive
   - Multiple brokers can have listing simultaneously
   - Only broker who procures ready, willing, and able buyer gets commission
   - Seller can sell themselves without paying commission

4. **Net Listing**:
   - Seller specifies minimum net amount they want
   - Broker keeps anything above that amount as commission
   - **Illegal in New Jersey** (N.J.A.C. 11:5-1.23)

**NJ-Specific Requirements**:
- All listing agreements must be in writing (Statute of Frauds)
- Must specify commission rate or calculation method
- Must have definite expiration date
- Must be signed by all parties

**Memory Aid**: "Exclusive agency = agent gets paid unless seller finds buyer. Exclusive right = agent always gets paid, day or night."

**Your Answer**: (Record your answer here before checking)

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to reveal answer and explanation</strong></summary>

**Correct Answer**: D. a contract that has not yet been fully performed.

**Detailed Explanation**:

**NJ Law Reference**: Contract law principles apply to real estate contracts in New Jersey.

**Contract Status Definitions**:

1. **Executory Contract**:
   - Contract that is in the process of being performed
   - Obligations still exist for one or both parties
   - **THIS IS THE CORRECT ANSWER**
   - Example: Real estate purchase contract before closing

2. **Executed Contract**:
   - Contract that has been fully performed
   - All obligations have been completed
   - Example: Deed after recording, completed sale

3. **Bilateral Contract**:
   - "Promise for a promise"
   - Both parties make promises to each other
   - Example: Real estate purchase contract (buyer promises to pay, seller promises to convey)

4. **Unilateral Contract**:
   - "Promise for an act"
   - One party promises something if the other performs an act
   - Example: Open listing (broker promises commission if they find buyer)

**NJ Real Estate Contract Stages**:
- **Offer and Acceptance**: Contract formed but executory
- **Attorney Review Period**: Executory (3 days in NJ residential)
- **Contingency Periods**: Executory (financing, inspection, etc.)
- **Closing**: Contract becomes executed
- **Post-Closing**: Fully executed

**NJ-Specific Considerations**:
- All real estate contracts must be in writing (Statute of Frauds)
- Attorney review period is unique to NJ residential transactions
- Time is of the essence in NJ real estate contracts

**Memory Aid**: "Executory = story still being told. Executed = all actions are old."
