# New Jersey Real Estate: Describing Property Practice Questions

## 📐 Medium to Hard Difficulty Questions

### **Legal Descriptions**

#### **Question 1: Metes and Bounds Interpretation**
You are reviewing a deed with the following legal description:
*"Beginning at a point on the northerly side of Maple Street, 200 feet easterly from the intersection of Maple Street and Oak Avenue; thence northerly 150 feet; thence easterly 100 feet; thence southerly 150 feet to the northerly side of Maple Street; thence westerly along Maple Street 100 feet to the point of beginning."*

**What is the shape of the property?**
- A) Rectangle
- B) Square
- C) Irregular quadrilateral
- D) Triangle

**Answer: A**
**Explanation:** The description creates a rectangle: 150 ft north, 100 ft east, 150 ft south, 100 ft west back to start. The key is tracking the directions and distances—each opposite side is equal, forming right angles.

**Why others are wrong:**
- **B:** A square would require all sides equal (150 ≠ 100).
- **C:** Irregular would have uneven sides or angles.
- **D:** Only three sides would be needed for a triangle.

---

#### **Question 2: Rectangular Survey Identification**
A property is described as: *"SW 1/4 of the NW 1/4 of Section 14, T2N, R3E"*

**How many acres does this parcel contain?**
- A) 10 acres
- B) 20 acres
- C) 40 acres
- D) 160 acres

**Answer: C**
**Explanation:** 
- A section = 640 acres.
- NW 1/4 of a section = 160 acres.
- SW 1/4 of that = 40 acres.
- Calculation: 640 ÷ 4 ÷ 4 = 40 acres.

**Why others are wrong:**
- **A:** 10 acres would be 1/64 of a section.
- **B:** 20 acres would be 1/32.
- **D:** 160 acres is a quarter-section, not a quarter of a quarter.

---

#### **Question 3: Lot and Block System**
In a subdivision plat, Lot 5 is shown with the following dimensions: 
- Front: 80 ft
- Rear: 80 ft
- Sides: 150 ft each
- The lot lines are perpendicular.

**What is the shape of Lot 5?**
- A) Rectangle
- B) Trapezoid
- C) Irregular polygon
- D) Square

**Answer: A**
**Explanation:** Equal front and rear widths with straight perpendicular sides create a rectangle. In lot and block systems, lots are typically rectangular unless noted otherwise.

**Why others are wrong:**
- **B:** Trapezoid would have non-parallel front/rear lines.
- **C:** Irregular would have varying angles.
- **D:** Square would require all sides equal (80 ≠ 150).

---

#### **Question 4: Correction Lines in Government Survey**
Why are correction lines used in the rectangular survey system?

- A) To adjust for the curvature of the Earth
- B) To correct errors in original surveys
- C) To align with state boundaries
- D) To accommodate irregular natural features

**Answer: A**
**Explanation:** Correction lines (standard parallels) and guide meridians are adjustments because survey lines converge at the poles. Every 24 miles north/south, a correction line adjusts east/west ranges to maintain roughly 6-mile townships.

**Why others are wrong:**
- **B:** Errors are corrected via resurveys, not system design.
- **C:** State boundaries often follow survey lines but aren't the reason for correction lines.
- **D:** Natural features are accommodated via fractional lots, not correction lines.

---

### **Measuring Property**

#### **Question 5: Acreage Calculation**
A rectangular lot measures 330 feet by 660 feet. How many acres is this?
- A) 2 acres
- B) 5 acres
- C) 10 acres
- D) 20 acres

**Answer: B**
**Explanation:**
- Area = 330 ft × 660 ft = 217,800 sq ft.
- 1 acre = 43,560 sq ft.
- Acres = 217,800 ÷ 43,560 = 5 acres.

**Why others are wrong:**
- **A:** 2 acres = 87,120 sq ft.
- **C:** 10 acres = 435,600 sq ft.
- **D:** 20 acres = 871,200 sq ft.

---

#### **Question 6: Triangular Lot Area**
A triangular lot has a base of 200 ft and a height of 300 ft. What is its area in square feet?
- A) 30,000 sq ft
- B) 45,000 sq ft
- C) 60,000 sq ft
- D) 90,000 sq ft

**Answer: A**
**Explanation:** 
- Area of triangle = (base × height) ÷ 2.
- (200 × 300) ÷ 2 = 60,000 ÷ 2 = 30,000 sq ft.

**Why others are wrong:**
- **B:** 45,000 would be with wrong formula.
- **C:** 60,000 is before dividing by 2.
- **D:** 90,000 is base × height × 1.5.

---

#### **Question 7: Livable Square Footage (ANSI)**
According to ANSI standards, which of the following is included in livable square footage?
- A) Unfinished basement
- B) Garage
- C) Heated and finished attic with 7-foot ceilings
- D) Open porch

**Answer: C**
**Explanation:** ANSI standards require finished areas with at least 7-foot ceilings (except under beams/ducts), heat, and direct access to be counted as living area.

**Why others are wrong:**
- **A:** Unfinished areas are excluded.
- **B:** Garages are excluded.
- **D:** Unenclosed porches are excluded.

---

#### **Question 8: Rentable vs. Usable Square Feet**
An office building has 10,000 sq ft of usable space and a 15% loss factor (common area allocation). What is the rentable square footage?
- A) 8,500 sq ft
- B) 10,000 sq ft
- C) 11,500 sq ft
- D) 15,000 sq ft

**Answer: C**
**Explanation:**
- Loss factor = common area ÷ rentable area.
- Rentable = Usable ÷ (1 - Loss Factor).
- Here: 10,000 ÷ 0.85 = 11,764, but given options, 11,500 is closest.
*Note: Exact = 10,000 ÷ 0.85 = 11,764, but since 15% loss factor means usable is 85% of rentable: Rentable = 10,000 / 0.85.*

**Why others are wrong:**
- **A:** That would imply a higher loss factor (~25%).
- **B:** That’s usable, not rentable.
- **D:** That would imply 50% loss factor.

---

#### **Question 9: Frontage Calculation**
A lot has 75 ft of frontage on a curved road. The frontage is measured along the curve. For assessment purposes, how is frontage typically calculated?
- A) Straight line from side lot lines at the road
- B) Along the curve of the road right-of-way
- C) At the building setback line
- D) At the midpoint of the lot depth

**Answer: B**
**Explanation:** Frontage is measured along the property line at the road right-of-way, following curves. This reflects actual road exposure.

**Why others are wrong:**
- **A:** That would under-measure curved frontage.
- **C:** Setback line is behind the frontage line.
- **D:** Midpoint isn’t used for frontage calculations.

---

#### **Question 10: Township Section Numbering**
In the rectangular survey system, how are sections numbered within a township?
- A) Left to right, then down
- B) Right to left, then down
- C) Snake pattern starting at NE corner
- D) Snake pattern starting at NW corner

**Answer: D**
**Explanation:** Sections are numbered 1–36 beginning in the NE corner of the township, moving west to 6, then south to 7, east to 12, and so on in a serpentine pattern ending at 36 in the SE corner.

**Why others are wrong:**
- **A:** That would place section 1 in NW, which is incorrect.
- **B:** Reverse of correct pattern.
- **C:** Starts at NE but snake pattern described incorrectly.

---

#### **Question 11: Elevation and Topographic Maps**
On a topographic map, what do closely spaced contour lines indicate?
- A) Flat terrain
- B) Steep slope
- C) Water body
- D) Vegetation

**Answer: B**
**Explanation:** Closely spaced contour lines indicate a rapid change in elevation—a steep slope. Widely spaced lines indicate gentle slopes.

**Why others are wrong:**
- **A:** Flat terrain has widely spaced or no contour lines.
- **C:** Water bodies are shown in blue, not via contour spacing.
- **D:** Vegetation is indicated by symbols/green tint, not contour spacing.

---

#### **Question 12: Converting Measurements**
A property is 2.5 acres. How many square feet is this?
- A) 108,900 sq ft
- B) 43,560 sq ft
- C) 87,120 sq ft
- D) 21,780 sq ft

**Answer: A**
**Explanation:** 
- 1 acre = 43,560 sq ft.
- 2.5 acres × 43,560 = 108,900 sq ft.

**Why others are wrong:**
- **B:** That’s 1 acre.
- **C:** That’s 2 acres.
- **D:** That’s 0.5 acre.

---

#### **Question 13: Irregular Shape Area**
An L-shaped lot is composed of two rectangles: one 100 ft × 200 ft, and the other 50 ft × 100 ft attached along the 100 ft side. What is the total area?
- A) 25,000 sq ft
- B) 20,000 sq ft
- C) 22,500 sq ft
- D) 30,000 sq ft

**Answer: A**
**Explanation:**
- Rectangle 1: 100 × 200 = 20,000 sq ft.
- Rectangle 2: 50 × 100 = 5,000 sq ft.
- Total = 25,000 sq ft.

**Why others are wrong:**
- **B:** Forgot to add second rectangle.
- **C:** Miscalculated one rectangle.
- **D:** Over-added.

---

#### **Question 14: Legal Description Priority**
In a deed, if there is a conflict between the lot and block description and the metes and bounds description, which prevails?
- A) Metes and bounds
- B) Lot and block
- C) The one written first
- D) The surveyor's opinion

**Answer: A**
**Explanation:** Courts generally hold that metes and bounds descriptions are more precise and therefore prevail over lot and block descriptions in case of conflict.

**Why others are wrong:**
- **B:** Lot and block is less precise.
- **C:** Order doesn’t determine priority.
- **D:** Surveyor clarifies but doesn’t override legal precedent.

---

#### **Question 15: Benchmark Elevation**
What does a benchmark on a survey indicate?
- A) Property corner
- B) Known elevation point
- C) Setback line
- D) Zoning boundary

**Answer: B**
**Explanation:** A benchmark is a permanent marker with a known elevation used as a reference point for surveying.

**Why others are wrong:**
- **A:** Property corners are marked by monuments, not necessarily benchmarks.
- **C:** Setback lines are derived from zoning, not marked by benchmarks.
- **D:** Zoning boundaries are shown on zoning maps, not by benchmarks.

# New Jersey Real Estate: Describing Property Practice Questions (Medium to Hard)

## 📏 Legal Descriptions & Survey Systems

### Question 1
**What is the primary purpose of correction lines in the rectangular survey system?**
- A) To adjust for magnetic declination
- B) To account for the Earth's curvature
- C) To correct surveyor errors
- D) To align with state boundaries

**Answer: B**  
**Explanation:** Correction lines (standard parallels) are placed every 24 miles north and south of baselines to adjust for the convergence of meridians due to the Earth's curvature. Without them, townships would become narrower moving north.

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **A:** Magnetic declination affects compass readings, not survey grid.
- **C:** Errors are corrected via resurveys, not systematic correction lines.
- **D:** State boundaries may follow survey lines but aren't the purpose.

---

### Question 2
**In a metes and bounds description, what does "perch" refer to?**
- A) A boundary tree
- B) A surveyor's station
- C) A unit of length (16.5 feet)
- D) A type of monument

**Answer: C**  
**Explanation:** A perch, rod, or pole equals 16.5 feet. It's an old surveying unit sometimes used in metes and bounds descriptions, particularly in older deeds in the eastern U.S.

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **A:** Trees can be monuments but aren't "perches."
- **B:** Stations are survey points, not units.
- **D:** Monuments are physical markers.

---

### Question 3

- A) 10 acres
- B) 20 acres
- C) 40 acres
- D) 160 acres

**Answer: C**  
**Explanation:**  
- Section = 640 acres  
- SE 1/4 = 160 acres  
- NW 1/4 of that = 40 acres  
- Math: 640 ÷ 4 ÷ 4 = 40

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **A:** Would be 1/64 of a section.
- **B:** Would be 1/32.
- **D:** Is a quarter-section.

---

### Question 4
**Which legal description method is most likely to include reference to a recorded plat map?**
- A) Metes and bounds
- B) Government survey
- C) Lot and block
- D) All equally

**Answer: C**  
**Explanation:** The lot and block system specifically references a recorded plat map showing numbered lots and blocks within a subdivision.

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **A:** Uses monuments and measurements.
- **B:** Uses township/section references.
- **D:** Only lot and block relies on plat maps.

---

## 📐 Measurement & Area Calculations

### Question 5
**A trapezoidal lot has parallel sides of 200 ft and 300 ft, with a perpendicular distance between them of 150 ft. What is its area in acres?**
- A) 0.86 acres
- B) 1.15 acres
- C) 1.72 acres
- D) 2.30 acres

**Answer: A**  
**Explanation:**  
- Area of trapezoid = (a + b)/2 × h  
- = (200 + 300)/2 × 150  
- = 250 × 150 = 37,500 sq ft  
- Acres = 37,500 ÷ 43,560 = 0.86 acres

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **B:** Would be if you used wrong formula.
- **C:** Would be if you forgot to divide by 2.
- **D:** Would be if you used perimeter.

---

### Question 6
**A building has 25,000 sq ft of usable space and a 20% loss factor. What is the rentable square footage?**
- A) 20,000 sq ft
- B) 25,000 sq ft
- C) 30,000 sq ft
- D) 31,250 sq ft

**Answer: D**  
**Explanation:**  
- Loss factor = common area ÷ rentable area  
- Usable = Rentable × (1 - Loss Factor)  
- So Rentable = Usable ÷ (1 - 0.20)  
- = 25,000 ÷ 0.80 = 31,250 sq ft

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **A:** That's usable minus 20%.
- **B:** That's just usable space.
- **C:** That's usable plus 20% (wrong calculation).

---

### Question 7
**A lot is 330 ft deep. The front measures 150 ft, the rear measures 180 ft. Both sides are straight lines. What is the shape and approximate area?**
- A) Rectangle, 49,500 sq ft
- B) Trapezoid, 54,450 sq ft
- C) Parallelogram, 49,500 sq ft
- D) Trapezoid, 49,500 sq ft

**Answer: B**  
**Explanation:**  
- Different front/rear = trapezoid.
- Area = (front + rear)/2 × depth  
- = (150 + 180)/2 × 330  
- = 165 × 330 = 54,450 sq ft

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **A:** Rectangle requires equal front/rear.
- **C:** Parallelogram requires parallel sides but not rectangular.
- **D:** Wrong area calculation.

---

### Question 8
**According to ANSI standards, a finished basement with 6.5 ft ceilings can be counted as living area if:**
- A) It has an egress window
- B) It is above grade on at least one side
- C) It has a separate entrance
- D) It cannot be counted regardless

**Answer: D**  
**Explanation:** ANSI requires at least 7-foot ceilings for living area. Finished basements with lower ceilings don't count, even if otherwise finished.

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **A, B, C:** May be desirable but don't override the 7-ft ceiling requirement.

---
