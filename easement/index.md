# Practice Questions: Easements and Related Topics (NJ Real Estate Exam)

## Question 1
Sarah owns a large parcel of land that is completely surrounded by properties owned by four different neighbors. She has no direct access to any public road. For the past 15 years, she has been using a driveway that crosses her neighbor Tom's property to reach the public street, but this use was based on an informal verbal agreement between Sarah and Tom's father, who previously owned Tom's property. Tom has now placed a locked gate across the driveway and refuses to allow Sarah to use it anymore. Sarah contacts an attorney to discuss her options for maintaining access to the public road. What legal remedy is most likely available to Sarah?

A. Easement by prescription, since she has used the driveway for 15 years
B. Easement by necessity, since her property is landlocked
C. Easement in gross, since she needs access for personal use
D. Easement by implication, since the previous owner allowed the use

**Correct Answer:** B. Easement by necessity, since her property is landlocked

**Explanation:** An easement by necessity arises when a property is landlocked, meaning it has no legal access to a public road. This type of easement is created by law to prevent a property from being completely unusable. Since Sarah's property is entirely surrounded by other properties with no access to public roads, courts will typically grant an easement by necessity across one of the neighboring properties to provide reasonable access. Option A is incorrect because easement by prescription requires open, notorious, continuous, and hostile use - Sarah's use was permissive (with permission), which defeats the hostile requirement. Option C is incorrect because an easement in gross benefits a person rather than a parcel of land and is typically used for utilities. Option D is incorrect because easement by implication requires the properties to have been under common ownership previously, which is not indicated here.

## Question 2
A utility company needs to install and maintain power lines across multiple properties in a residential neighborhood. The company has negotiated with each property owner and obtained the right to enter the properties, install poles and lines, and perform maintenance and repairs as needed. The utility company does not own any specific property in the neighborhood but needs these rights to serve its customers throughout the region. Property owners retain full ownership and use of their land, subject to the utility company's limited rights. What type of easement has been created?

A. Easement appurtenant benefiting the utility company's headquarters
B. Easement in gross benefiting the utility company
C. Easement by necessity for essential services
D. Easement by prescription through continuous use

**Correct Answer:** B. Easement in gross benefiting the utility company

**Explanation:** An easement in gross is a personal right that benefits an individual or entity rather than a parcel of land. It does not have a dominant tenement (benefited property), only a servient tenement (burdened property). Utility easements are classic examples of easements in gross - the utility company holds the right to use the property for its lines and equipment, but this right is not attached to any particular piece of land the utility company owns. The easement benefits the utility company as an entity. These easements are typically transferable to successor utility companies. Option A is incorrect because the easement doesn't benefit any specific property owned by the utility company. Option C is incorrect because easements by necessity arise from landlocked situations. Option D is incorrect because these easements were created by agreement, not through adverse use over time.

## Question 3
Robert owns Lot A, and his neighbor Jennifer owns adjacent Lot B. Twenty-five years ago, when both lots were owned by the same person, a driveway was constructed that runs along the border between the two properties. When the original owner divided and sold the lots separately, no easement was explicitly mentioned in either deed. However, the driveway has continued to serve as the primary access for Lot B to reach the public street, and Lot B has no other practical access route. Robert now wants to build a fence that would block Jennifer's use of the shared driveway. Jennifer hires an attorney to prevent Robert from blocking her access. What is Jennifer's strongest legal argument?

A. She has an easement by necessity because Lot B is landlocked
B. She has an easement by prescription due to 25 years of continuous use
C. She has an easement by implication from prior existing use
D. She has a license to use the driveway that cannot be revoked

**Correct Answer:** C. She has an easement by implication from prior existing use

**Explanation:** An easement by implication (also called implied easement from prior use) arises when: (1) a single owner previously owned both properties; (2) the owner used part of the property (the driveway) for the benefit of another part; (3) this use was apparent and continuous; (4) the use was reasonably necessary; and (5) the properties were then divided and sold. All these elements are met here. The driveway existed and was being used when the lots were under common ownership, it provided necessary access, and it continued after the division. Courts will imply an easement even though it wasn't explicitly written in the deed. Option A might also apply if Lot B truly has no other access, but the question states the driveway has been the "primary" access, not necessarily the only one. Option B is incorrect because Jennifer's use was likely permissive (not hostile) since both parties assumed she had the right to use it. Option D is incorrect because a license is revocable, unlike an easement.

## Question 4
Margaret owns a property that benefits from an easement across her neighbor David's land, allowing her to access a private lake for recreational purposes. The easement was created by a written agreement 40 years ago and was properly recorded. Margaret's property is considered the dominant tenement, and David's property is the servient tenement. Margaret has recently decided to sell her property to a developer who plans to build a small resort. David objects, claiming that the easement was personal to Margaret and cannot be transferred to the new owner. He argues that a resort with multiple guests using the easement would constitute an excessive burden on his property. Who is correct?

A. David is correct; easements for recreational purposes are personal and do not transfer with the property
B. Margaret is correct; an easement appurtenant runs with the land and transfers to subsequent owners
C. David is correct if the increased use constitutes an unreasonable expansion of the easement's scope
D. Margaret is correct only if she obtains David's written permission for the transfer

**Correct Answer:** C. David is correct if the increased use constitutes an unreasonable expansion of the easement's scope

**Explanation:** This question involves the principle of easement scope and burden. An easement appurtenant does run with the land and transfers automatically to subsequent owners - Margaret is correct about that. However, the new owner must use the easement in a manner consistent with its original purpose and scope. While Margaret used the easement for personal recreational access to the lake, a resort with numerous guests would likely constitute a significantly increased burden on David's servient estate. Courts examine whether the use has been unreasonably expanded beyond what was contemplated when the easement was created. A dramatic increase in the volume, frequency, or intensity of use may exceed the scope of the original easement. David could potentially obtain an injunction limiting the use to a level consistent with the original residential purpose, even though he cannot completely block the easement. The easement does transfer, but the scope of permissible use may be limited.

## Question 5
Thomas owns Lot 1, which has an access easement across Jennifer's Lot 2 to reach a public road. The easement was created by an express grant in a deed 30 years ago and specifically states it is for "vehicular access to and from the public road." For the past 30 years, Thomas has used a gravel path about 10 feet wide. Thomas now wants to pave the easement area, widen it to 20 feet to accommodate larger delivery trucks for his expanding home business, and install drainage pipes underneath. Jennifer objects to all of these changes. She claims Thomas must use the easement exactly as it has been used historically and cannot make any improvements or modifications. What are Thomas's rights regarding modifications to the easement?

A. Thomas cannot make any changes without Jennifer's written consent since she owns the underlying land
B. Thomas can make reasonable improvements necessary for the easement's intended use, but cannot unreasonably increase the burden on the servient estate
C. Thomas can do whatever he wants within the easement area since he has the dominant estate rights
D. Thomas must petition the court for permission before making any physical changes to the easement

**Correct Answer:** B. Thomas can make reasonable improvements necessary for the easement's intended use, but cannot unreasonably increase the burden on the servient estate

**Explanation:** The holder of an easement appurtenant (the dominant estate owner) generally has the right to make reasonable improvements and repairs to the easement area to facilitate the easement's intended use. This is known as the right of reasonable use. Paving a previously gravel driveway and installing drainage would typically be considered reasonable improvements that don't change the fundamental nature of vehicular access. However, significantly widening the easement from 10 feet to 20 feet would likely be considered an unreasonable expansion that increases the burden on Jennifer's property beyond what was originally contemplated. The scope of the easement is determined by its original purpose - here, "vehicular access." While Thomas can maintain and improve the easement for that purpose, he cannot substantially expand it in a way that imposes a significantly greater burden on the servient estate. Courts balance the dominant estate owner's need for reasonable use against the servient estate owner's interest in minimizing interference with their property.

## Question 6
Gloria owns a lakefront property and has granted her neighbor, Paulo, an easement to cross her land to access the lake for fishing and swimming. The easement agreement was in writing, properly signed, and recorded. For five years, Paulo regularly used a worn path across Gloria's property to reach the lake. Gloria has now sold her lakefront property to a developer who plans to build a private resort. The developer has erected a fence across the path and refuses to allow Paulo access, claiming they never agreed to the easement and that Paulo's rights terminated when Gloria sold the property. Paulo insists he still has the right to access the lake. What is the likely outcome?

A. Paulo's easement terminated when Gloria sold the property because easements are personal rights
B. Paulo's easement continues because it was properly recorded and runs with the land
C. The developer can terminate the easement by paying Paulo reasonable compensation
D. Paulo must negotiate a new easement agreement with the developer

**Correct Answer:** B. Paulo's easement continues because it was properly recorded and runs with the land

**Explanation:** An easement appurtenant "runs with the land," meaning it automatically transfers to subsequent owners of both the dominant and servient estates. Because Paulo's easement was created by written agreement and properly recorded, it provides constructive notice to any future purchaser of Gloria's property. The developer bought the property subject to Paulo's existing easement rights. Recording statutes protect properly recorded interests, and a title search would have revealed Paulo's easement. The developer takes the property burdened by the same easement that existed when Gloria owned it. Paulo doesn't need to renegotiate anything - his rights continue automatically. This is a fundamental principle of easement law: appurtenant easements bind successive owners of the servient estate. Option A is incorrect because easements appurtenant are property rights, not personal rights (unlike easements in gross, which can be personal). Option C is incorrect because private parties cannot unilaterally extinguish easements through forced compensation - that would require eminent domain powers.

## Question 7
Daniel owns a property that he accesses by crossing a driveway on his neighbor Karen's property. However, Daniel has never had a written easement agreement; he has simply used the driveway openly and continuously for the past 22 years with no permission asked or given. Karen inherited the property 10 years ago and was unaware that Daniel had been using the driveway since before she owned it. Karen has now discovered Daniel's use and wants to block his access by installing a gate. Daniel claims he has a legal right to continue using the driveway. Under New Jersey law, which requires 20 years of adverse use to establish a prescriptive easement, what is the likely outcome?

A. Daniel has no rights because he never obtained written permission from Karen
B. Daniel has acquired an easement by prescription through his 22 years of continuous use
C. Daniel's use must have been with Karen's knowledge to be valid, so he has no easement
D. Karen can revoke Daniel's access because she never personally gave him permission

**Correct Answer:** B. Daniel has acquired an easement by prescription through his 22 years of continuous use

**Explanation:** An easement by prescription is acquired through adverse use that is: (1) open and notorious (visible and obvious), (2) continuous and uninterrupted, (3) hostile (without permission), and (4) for the statutory period (20 years in New Jersey). Daniel's use meets all these requirements. The use doesn't need to be with the current owner's knowledge - it just needs to be open and obvious such that a reasonable owner would be aware of it. The fact that Karen only recently discovered it doesn't negate the prescriptive period that had already been running. The 22 years of use counts even though different people owned the servient property during that time; Daniel can "tack" the periods together. Once a prescriptive easement is established, it becomes a property right that runs with the land, just like an express easement. Option C is incorrect because actual knowledge by the owner is not required - the use just needs to be open and notorious. Option D is incorrect because Karen's lack of personal consent is irrelevant once the prescriptive period has run.

## Question 8
A large residential subdivision was developed in 1985. The original developer included restrictive covenants in all the deeds requiring that: (1) homes must be at least 2,500 square feet, (2) no commercial businesses may operate on the properties, (3) no structures can be built within 30 feet of the front property line, and (4) all homes must be single-family residences. These restrictions were properly recorded and appeared in every deed. Maria purchased a home in the subdivision in 2020. She now wants to build a 1,800 square foot accessory dwelling unit (ADU) in her backyard to house her elderly mother and potentially generate rental income. The local zoning allows ADUs, but the HOA claims the restrictive covenant prohibits it because it violates the square footage and single-family requirements. Can Maria build the ADU?

A. Yes, because local zoning laws override private restrictive covenants
B. No, because restrictive covenants run with the land and bind future owners
C. Yes, because restrictive covenants older than 30 years are no longer enforceable
D. No, unless she obtains written consent from every property owner in the subdivision

**Correct Answer:** B. No, because restrictive covenants run with the land and bind future owners

**Explanation:** Restrictive covenants (also called deed restrictions or CC&Rs - Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions) are private agreements that limit how property can be used. When properly recorded and included in deeds, these covenants "run with the land" and bind all subsequent purchasers, regardless of whether they personally agreed to them. Maria's purchase of the property was subject to these existing restrictions, which she should have discovered through a title search. The covenant prohibiting structures under 2,500 square feet and requiring single-family use would likely prevent the ADU construction, even though local zoning permits it. When there's a conflict between zoning and restrictive covenants, the more restrictive requirement typically controls - property owners must comply with both. Option A is incorrect because private covenants are enforceable contracts that exist independently of zoning. Option C is incorrect because restrictive covenants don't automatically expire based on age (though courts may decline to enforce them if they've been abandoned or circumstances have substantially changed). Option D is incorrect because the HOA or affected neighbors can typically enforce the restrictions without unanimous consent.

## Question 9
Richard owns a commercial property in downtown Newark. A title search reveals that his property is subject to an easement granted 60 years ago to the City of Newark for "public utility purposes." The easement runs along the rear 15 feet of his property. For the past 60 years, the city has maintained underground water and sewer lines within this easement area. Richard now wants to build a parking garage that would include underground parking levels extending into the easement area. He argues that the underground parking wouldn't interfere with the utility lines because modern construction techniques would allow him to build around them. The city objects, claiming Richard cannot build any permanent structures within the easement area. Who is correct?

A. Richard is correct because he owns the land and can use it as long as he doesn't damage the existing utilities
B. The city is correct because the easement holder has the right to exclusive use of the easement area
C. Richard is correct if he obtains proper engineering certification that the utilities won't be damaged
D. The city is correct because permanent structures would interfere with the city's ability to maintain and access the utilities

**Correct Answer:** D. The city is correct because permanent structures would interfere with the city's ability to maintain and access the utilities

**Explanation:** When an easement is granted for utility purposes, the easement holder (here, the city) needs reasonable access to install, maintain, repair, and replace utility infrastructure. While the servient estate owner (Richard) retains ownership of the land and can make some uses of it, he cannot interfere with the easement's intended purpose. Building underground parking structures within the utility easement would severely restrict the city's ability to access, maintain, and replace the utility lines. If a water or sewer line breaks or needs upgrading, the city would need to excavate, potentially requiring removal or damage to Richard's parking structure. Courts typically hold that permanent structures that impede reasonable access for easement purposes are prohibited, even if they don't physically damage existing utilities at the time of construction. The servient estate owner's use rights are subordinate to the easement holder's rights. Richard can likely use the surface area for landscaping, sidewalks, or other uses that don't impede underground access, but substantial permanent structures would not be permitted.

## Question 10
Twenty years ago, Elizabeth granted her neighbor Frank a written easement to use a portion of her driveway to access Frank's garage. The easement was properly executed and recorded. Five years ago, Frank demolished his garage and converted that area of his property into a garden. He stopped using Elizabeth's driveway entirely because he no longer needed garage access. Elizabeth has now sold her property to new owners who want to know if Frank can resume using the driveway at any time. They are concerned because they plan to expand their own garage into the area where the easement is located. Can Frank resume using the easement, or has it been extinguished through non-use?

A. The easement has been extinguished through five years of non-use
B. The easement still exists and Frank can resume use at any time
C. The easement has been abandoned because Frank no longer has a garage
D. The easement terminated when Elizabeth sold her property

**Correct Answer:** B. The easement still exists and Frank can resume use at any time

**Explanation:** Mere non-use of an easement, even for an extended period, does not extinguish it. To terminate an easement through abandonment, there must be both: (1) non-use AND (2) clear intent to permanently abandon the easement (usually shown through actions that are inconsistent with the easement's continued existence). Simply not using an easement isn't enough - the dominant estate owner must take some affirmative action indicating an intent to relinquish the right permanently. For example, Frank would need to execute and record a written release of the easement, or perhaps physically block his own access in a way that shows permanent abandonment. Just demolishing the garage and planting a garden doesn't clearly demonstrate intent to abandon the access rights forever - Frank might rebuild a garage, or the property might be sold to someone who wants to build one. The easement continues to run with Frank's land and would transfer to any future owner. The new owners of Elizabeth's property take the property subject to the existing easement burden. Before expanding their garage into the easement area, they should consider that Frank (or a future owner of Frank's property) could potentially resume use of the easement.

## Question 11
A city is planning to widen a major highway and needs to acquire a 20-foot strip of land along the front of Marcus's property. The city has offered to purchase the strip through negotiation, but Marcus refuses to sell at any price because the taking would eliminate his landscaping and force him to relocate his fence. The city proceeds with a formal condemnation action, arguing it has the right to take the property for the highway widening project, which will benefit the public by reducing traffic congestion. Marcus argues that the city cannot simply take his land against his will. He files a lawsuit challenging the condemnation. What is the likely outcome?

A. Marcus will win because property owners have an absolute right to refuse to sell their property
B. The city will win if it provides just compensation, because governments have eminent domain power for public purposes
C. Marcus will win because highway widening doesn't qualify as a public use
D. The city will win only if it can prove Marcus's refusal to sell is unreasonable

**Correct Answer:** B. The city will win if it provides just compensation, because governments have eminent domain power for public purposes

**Explanation:** Eminent domain is the government's constitutional power to take private property for public use, even over the owner's objection, provided the government pays just compensation (fair market value). This power is granted by the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (applied to states through the Fourteenth Amendment) and is also recognized in New Jersey's constitution. Highway widening clearly qualifies as a public use because it benefits the general public through improved transportation infrastructure. Marcus cannot absolutely refuse the taking, but he has rights: (1) the right to receive just compensation (fair market value for the property taken), (2) the right to challenge the amount of compensation offered, and (3) the right to challenge whether the taking truly serves a public purpose (though highway widening clearly does). If Marcus believes the city's compensation offer is too low, he can contest the valuation, but he cannot prevent the taking entirely if it serves a legitimate public purpose. Property ownership rights, while strong, are not absolute when they conflict with legitimate government needs for public projects.

## Question 12
Jennifer's property is located in a residential zone that permits single-family homes with minimum lot sizes of 10,000 square feet. She owns a 9,500 square foot lot that existed before the current zoning ordinance was adopted. The previous zoning allowed 7,500 square foot lots. Jennifer's home was built 40 years ago when the lot was conforming. Jennifer now wants to tear down the old house and build a new, larger home on the same lot. The zoning officer denies her building permit, stating that the 9,500 square foot lot doesn't meet the current 10,000 square foot minimum. Jennifer argues that her lot should be protected. What is Jennifer's best legal argument?

A. She has an easement by necessity to build on her own property
B. Her lot is a legal nonconforming use (grandfathered in) that can continue
C. The zoning change constitutes a taking requiring compensation
D. She can claim a variance as a matter of right because the lot existed first

**Correct Answer:** B. Her lot is a legal nonconforming use (grandfathered in) that can continue

**Explanation:** A legal nonconforming use (often called "grandfathered" use) exists when a property or use was legal when established but doesn't comply with current zoning regulations due to a subsequent zoning change. Jennifer's 9,500 square foot lot was legal and conforming under the old zoning. Generally, nonconforming lots, structures, and uses are allowed to continue, and in most jurisdictions, property owners can rebuild or make reasonable improvements. However, the extent of rebuilding rights varies by jurisdiction. Some allow complete reconstruction; others impose limitations. Jennifer should be permitted to build on her legal nonconforming lot, though she may face restrictions on increasing the degree of nonconformity (for example, she might not be able to violate current setback requirements even if the old house did). Option C is incorrect because the mere existence of more restrictive zoning doesn't typically constitute a compensable taking unless it destroys all economic use of the property. Option D is incorrect because variances are not granted "as a matter of right" - they require proving undue hardship, though Jennifer's nonconforming lot status gives her a strong case.

## Question 13
A developer purchased a 100-acre tract of land and created a subdivision called "Green Meadows" with 200 single-family home lots. When selling the lots, the developer included in every deed a restrictive covenant stating: "No fences over 4 feet in height may be erected in front yards." This restriction was also recorded in a subdivision declaration. Over the past 20 years, approximately 40% of homeowners have built fences taller than 4 feet in their front yards, and the homeowners association has never enforced the restriction. Patricia, a new homeowner, just built a 6-foot privacy fence in her front yard. Her neighbor Theodore wants to force her to remove it, citing the restrictive covenant. Patricia argues the restriction is no longer enforceable. Who is correct?

A. Theodore is correct because restrictive covenants never expire and are always enforceable
B. Patricia is correct because the widespread violation and non-enforcement amount to abandonment of the restriction
C. Theodore is correct because he has the right to enforce any recorded restriction regardless of past enforcement
D. Patricia is correct because residential fence restrictions violate public policy

**Correct Answer:** B. Patricia is correct because the widespread violation and non-enforcement amount to abandonment of the restriction

**Explanation:** While restrictive covenants generally run with the land and bind future owners, they can become unenforceable through abandonment or changed circumstances. Abandonment occurs when there has been such pervasive violation of a restriction, coupled with non-enforcement by those entitled to enforce it, that continuing to enforce the restriction would be inequitable. Here, 40% of homeowners have violated the fence restriction (a substantial percentage), and the HOA has never enforced it, showing a pattern of non-enforcement. Courts may find that the restriction has been effectively abandoned through acquiescence. However, the outcome isn't certain - some courts require evidence of nearly universal abandonment (not just 40%). Theodore might argue he personally hasn't violated the restriction and has the right to enforcement. But Patricia has a strong argument that selective enforcement after years of widespread violations would be unfair. This is different from the restriction simply expiring - it remains in the deeds, but equitable principles may prevent enforcement. Generally, the more widespread the violations and the longer the non-enforcement, the stronger the abandonment argument.

## Question 14
Robert owns a property with an old barn that sits 8 feet from the side property line. Current zoning requires all structures to be at least 15 feet from side property lines. The barn was built 75 years ago, long before the current zoning was enacted, and it was legal when constructed. The barn has fallen into severe disrepair and is structurally unsound. Robert wants to demolish it and build a new, modern storage building in exactly the same location, also 8 feet from the property line. The zoning officer denies his permit, stating that while the old barn was a legal nonconforming structure, once Robert demolishes it, he cannot rebuild in the same nonconforming location. Robert must comply with the current 15-foot setback for any new structure. Is the zoning officer correct?

A. No, Robert has the right to rebuild in the exact same location since the barn was legally nonconforming
B. Yes, voluntary demolition of a nonconforming structure typically terminates the nonconforming status
C. No, nonconforming rights run with the land permanently and cannot be terminated
D. Yes, but only if Robert receives compensation for the loss of his nonconforming rights

**Correct Answer:** B. Yes, voluntary demolition of a nonconforming structure typically terminates the nonconforming status

**Explanation:** Legal nonconforming structures are generally protected and can continue to exist, but many jurisdictions have rules limiting reconstruction, especially after voluntary demolition. The policy reasoning is that communities should gradually come into compliance with current standards, and voluntary removal of a nonconforming structure provides an opportunity to achieve conformity. If the barn had been destroyed by fire, storm, or other involuntary cause, Robert might have stronger rights to rebuild (though jurisdictions vary on this). However, when an owner voluntarily demolishes a nonconforming structure, many jurisdictions hold that the nonconforming status is terminated. New construction must comply with current regulations. Some ordinances allow rebuilding within a limited timeframe after involuntary destruction (like 1-2 years after a fire), but typically prohibit rebuilding after voluntary demolition. Option A incorrectly assumes nonconforming rights are absolute. Option C is incorrect because nonconforming rights can be lost through abandonment, voluntary demolition, or destruction beyond a certain threshold (like 50% damage). Option D is incorrect because termination of nonconforming status through voluntary demolition doesn't constitute a taking requiring compensation.

## Question 15
Maria owns a property in a zone designated for single-family residential use only. She wants to convert her garage into a small commercial art studio where she would teach painting classes to groups of up to 10 students and sell her artwork. This would clearly violate the residential zoning. However, Maria's lot has an unusual shape - it's extremely narrow (only 30 feet wide) and very deep (400 feet), making it impractical for typical residential development. Most neighbors have standard rectangular lots. Additionally, Maria's property backs up to a commercial zone where similar art studios are permitted. Maria applies for a variance to allow the commercial use. Based on typical variance standards, is Maria likely to be granted a variance?

A. Yes, because her property's unusual dimensions create a practical difficulty that warrants relief
B. No, because she can still use the property for its zoned residential purpose
C. Yes, because the property is adjacent to a commercial zone
D. No, because granting a commercial variance in a residential zone would harm public welfare

**Correct Answer:** B. No, because she can still use the property for its zoned residential purpose

**Explanation:** To obtain a use variance (permission to use property in a way not permitted by zoning), an applicant typically must prove: (1) unique hardship due to physical characteristics of the property (not personal or financial circumstances), (2) inability to receive a reasonable return from any permitted use, (3) the hardship was not self-created, and (4) granting the variance won't substantially harm the public good or zone plan. Use variances are difficult to obtain because they involve changing the permitted use, not just dimensional requirements. Maria's situation fails the key test: she can still use the property for its permitted residential purpose. The lot's unusual shape might support an area or setback variance (for dimensions), but doesn't justify changing from residential to commercial use. Her desire to run a business is a personal financial preference, not a hardship caused by unique physical characteristics of the land. Even though the property abuts commercial zoning, residential use is still viable. Courts distinguish between practical difficulty (which might justify an area variance for dimensions) and unnecessary hardship (required for a use variance). Maria hasn't shown that residential use is impossible or that the property cannot yield a reasonable return under residential zoning - she just prefers commercial use.

## Question 16
A city adopted a comprehensive zoning plan 30 years ago that designated a particular waterfront area as residential. Since then, the character of the neighborhood has substantially changed. Currently, 75% of properties in the area have been converted to restaurants, shops, and offices, many through granted variances or illegal conversions that were never enforced against. Only a handful of homes remain. David owns one of the remaining residential properties and wants to convert it to a restaurant to match the neighborhood's current character. He applies for a variance or rezoning. The zoning board denies his application, stating that the zoning map still shows residential designation and no formal rezoning has occurred. David argues that the area has been effectively rezoned through changed circumstances. What legal doctrine might support David's argument?

A. Easement by prescription
B. Spot zoning
C. Constructive or defacto rezoning through changed circumstances
D. Legal nonconforming status

**Correct Answer:** C. Constructive or de facto rezoning through changed circumstances

**Explanation:** Some jurisdictions recognize that when the character of a neighborhood has changed so substantially that the existing zoning no longer reflects reality, and when the government has effectively acquiesced to this change through non-enforcement or widespread variance granting, there may be an argument for "de facto" or constructive rezoning. David could argue that: (1) the actual use of properties in the area overwhelmingly contradicts the zoning designation, (2) the city has effectively allowed this through non-enforcement and granting variances to others, and (3) maintaining the residential zoning for his property while the surrounding area is commercial creates an inequitable situation. However, this is a challenging argument because formal rezoning typically requires official legislative action. The city might counter that two wrongs don't make a right - widespread violation doesn't create a right to violate. Some courts have found that dramatic changed circumstances, combined with government acquiescence, can support a rezoning claim or make denial of a variance arbitrary. David might also argue the denial violates equal protection if others received similar relief. This situation illustrates the tension between formal zoning requirements and practical reality in evolving neighborhoods.

## Question 17
Ten property owners in a residential neighborhood have formed a homeowners association and have all signed a recorded covenant agreeing to maintain minimum standards for property appearance, including regular lawn maintenance, exterior paint upkeep, and prohibition of junk vehicles. The covenant states it binds "all owners, their heirs, and assigns." Sarah, who was one of the original ten owners who signed the covenant, has now sold her property to Marcus. Marcus was informed of the covenant during the purchase process, and it was noted in his title report, but he personally never signed any agreement. Marcus refuses to maintain his lawn and has several inoperable vehicles in his driveway. The HOA seeks to enforce the covenant against Marcus. Marcus argues he never agreed to these restrictions. Can the HOA enforce the covenant against Marcus?

A. No, because Marcus never personally signed the covenant agreement
B. Yes, because the covenant runs with the land and binds successors
C. No, because restrictive covenants must be re-signed by each new owner
D. Yes, but only if Marcus received actual notice in writing at closing

**Correct Answer:** B. Yes, because the covenant runs with the land and binds successors

**Explanation:** Restrictive covenants that meet certain legal requirements "run with the land," meaning they automatically bind future owners regardless of whether they personally agreed to them. For a covenant to run with the land and bind successors, it typically must: (1) be in writing, (2) be intended to bind successors (which this one explicitly states), (3) "touch and concern" the land (relate to the use or value of the property), (4) be between parties in privity of estate (successive ownership satisfies this), and (5) be recorded to provide constructive notice. This covenant appears to meet all requirements. Marcus received notice through the title report, and even without actual notice, the recorded covenant provides constructive notice. The phrase "heirs and assigns" clearly indicates intent to bind future owners. Property maintenance standards "touch and concern" the land because they affect property use and value. Marcus's personal signature is not required - he purchased the property subject to existing recorded restrictions. This is a fundamental principle of property law: recorded restrictions run with the land and bind purchasers. Option D is incorrect because recording provides sufficient notice even without actual written notice at closing (though good practice requires disclosure).

## Question 18
A developer owns a large parcel of undeveloped land adjacent to an existing residential subdivision. The developer's land is currently zoned agricultural, but the developer wants to build a shopping center. The developer applies for rezoning from agricultural to commercial. The existing nearby homeowners strongly object, arguing that a shopping center will increase traffic, noise, and decrease their property values. They also point out that the comprehensive master plan for the city designates this area for future residential growth, not commercial development. The developer argues the shopping center will generate tax revenue and provide convenient shopping for area residents. The city council has the authority to grant or deny the rezoning. What factors should the council consider?

A. Only the potential tax revenue the shopping center would generate
B. Only whether the rezoning conforms to the comprehensive master plan
C. Multiple factors including the master plan, impact on surrounding properties, traffic, and community needs
D. Only the objections of neighboring property owners

**Correct Answer:** C. Multiple factors including the master plan, impact on surrounding properties, traffic, and community needs

**Explanation:** Rezoning decisions are legislative acts that should be based on comprehensive planning principles and the public welfare. Courts generally give legislative bodies broad discretion in rezoning matters, but the decision should be based on sound planning principles and not be arbitrary or unreasonable. Factors typically considered include: (1) consistency with the comprehensive/master plan (though deviation may be justified), (2) compatibility with surrounding land uses and character of the neighborhood, (3) impact on traffic, infrastructure, and public services, (4) changed circumstances since the original zoning, (5) community needs (is there demand for the proposed use?), (6) impact on property values, (7) environmental concerns, and (8) whether the rezoning would constitute "spot zoning" (small area rezoned for benefit of single owner in a way inconsistent with surrounding area). While the master plan is important, it's not absolutely binding - conditions change and plans can be updated. Neighbor objections matter but aren't determinative - some objection is expected with any change. Tax revenue is relevant but shouldn't be the sole consideration. The council should balance all these factors. If they approve the rezoning despite master plan inconsistency, they should articulate legitimate planning reasons for the change.

## Question 19
Patricia owns a residential property subject to several restrictions: (1) a recorded restrictive covenant from 1975 prohibiting fences over 4 feet high, (2) an HOA rule from 2010 prohibiting any fences in front yards, and (3) a city zoning ordinance from 2015 prohibiting front yard fences that block sight lines at corner lots. Patricia's property is a corner lot. She wants to build a 3-foot decorative fence in her front yard that would not block sight lines. The HOA threatens to fine her, claiming their rule prohibits any front yard fences regardless of height. Patricia argues her 3-foot fence should be permitted because it complies with the recorded covenant (under 4 feet) and the zoning ordinance (doesn't block sight lines). Who is correct?

A. Patricia is correct because her fence complies with the most restrictive requirement (the HOA rule)
B. The HOA is correct because their rule is the most restrictive and property owners must comply with the most restrictive requirement
C. Patricia is correct because HOA rules cannot be more restrictive than recorded covenants
D. The HOA is correct only if their rules were properly adopted according to the association's governing documents

**Correct Answer:** B. The HOA is correct because their rule is the most restrictive and property owners must comply with the most restrictive requirement

**Explanation:** When property is subject to multiple restrictions from different sources (zoning ordinances, recorded covenants, and HOA rules), owners must generally comply with ALL of them, and in cases of conflict, the most restrictive requirement typically controls. Here, Patricia faces three different restrictions: the 1975 covenant allows up to 4 feet, the zoning allows fences that don't block sight lines, but the HOA rule prohibits ALL front yard fences. The HOA rule is most restrictive. HOA rules that are properly adopted pursuant to the association's recorded CC&Rs (Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions) and bylaws can be more restrictive than the underlying recorded covenants, as long as the governing documents grant the HOA authority to adopt such rules. Most HOA governing documents include provisions allowing the board to adopt reasonable rules and regulations. Patricia must comply with all three restrictions. Since the HOA rule is the most restrictive (no fences at all), she cannot build her 3-foot fence even though it would comply with the other two restrictions. Option D notes an important caveat - the HOA rules must have been properly adopted according to the association's procedures, but assuming they were, the HOA can enforce them.

## Question 20
James owns a 50-acre farm that has been in his family for four generations. A proposed highway project would require the state to take 5 acres along the front of his property for the highway right-of-way. The taking would not eliminate access to the remaining 45 acres, but it would take some of James's best agricultural land and would bring the highway within 100 feet of his farmhouse, substantially increasing noise and decreasing the property's value as a residence. The state has offered James $150,000 for the 5-acre strip, which represents fair market value for the land based on comparable sales. However, James argues he should receive additional compensation for: (1) the reduced value of his remaining 45 acres due to highway proximity (severance damages), (2) loss of agricultural productivity, and (3) emotional distress from losing family land. Is James entitled to additional compensation beyond the $150,000?

A. Yes, he is entitled to severance damages for the reduced value of the remaining property, but not for lost productivity or emotional distress
B. Yes, he is entitled to all three types of additional compensation he claims
C. No, just compensation means fair market value of the land taken only
D. Yes, but only if he can prove the state's actions were intentionally malicious

**Correct Answer:** A. Yes, he is entitled to severance damages for the reduced value of the remaining property, but not for lost productivity or emotional distress

**Explanation:** "Just compensation" under the Fifth Amendment requires payment of fair market value for property taken. When only part of a property is taken (partial taking), the owner is entitled to: (1) the value of the land actually taken, AND (2) severance damages - the diminution in value to the remaining property caused by the taking or the project. Severance damages compensate for effects like loss of access, increased noise, visual impairment, or other impacts that reduce the value of the remaining land. Courts typically calculate this as: (value of whole property before taking) minus (value of land taken) minus (value of remaining property after taking) = total compensation. However, purely consequential damages like emotional distress, sentimental value, lost business opportunities, or lost profits are generally NOT compensable - only diminution in fair market value counts. The fact that James's family has owned the farm for generations doesn't increase compensation. Courts focus on objective market value, not subjective personal value. James should have his property appraised both before and after the taking to demonstrate severance damages. If the remaining 45 acres is worth significantly less due to highway proximity, noise, dust, and loss of the best agricultural land, this diminution should be compensated.
