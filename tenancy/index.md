## Question 1
Which form of ownership automatically includes the right of survivorship?
A. Tenancy in Common
B. Tenancy in Severalty
C. Joint Tenancy
D. Tenancy at Will

**Correct Answer:** C. Joint Tenancy

**Explanation:** Joint tenancy includes the right of survivorship, meaning when one owner dies, their interest automatically passes to the surviving joint tenant(s), bypassing probate.

---

## Question 2
A property owned by four individuals, each holding a 25% interest that they can sell independently, is MOST likely held as:
A. Joint Tenancy
B. Tenancy by the Entireties
C. Tenancy in Common
D. Community Property

**Correct Answer:** C. Tenancy in Common

**Explanation:** Tenancy in common allows each owner to hold separate, divisible interests that can be sold or transferred without the consent of other owners. There is no right of survivorship.

---

## Question 3
Which characteristic is required for all four unities in a joint tenancy?
A. Time, Title, Interest, and Possession
B. Time, Trust, Income, and Property
C. Title, Transfer, Investment, and Payment
D. Tenancy, Transaction, Interest, and Price

**Correct Answer:** A. Time, Title, Interest, and Possession

**Explanation:** For a valid joint tenancy in New Jersey, all four unities must be present: owners must acquire title at the same time, by the same deed, with equal interests, and equal rights to possess the entire property.

---

## Question 4
When one joint tenant sells their interest to a third party, the new owner holds the property as a:
A. Joint tenant with the remaining owners
B. Tenant in common with the remaining owners
C. Tenant by the entireties with the remaining owners
D. Tenant in severalty

**Correct Answer:** B. Tenant in common with the remaining owners

**Explanation:** Selling a joint tenancy interest breaks the unity of time and title, converting the new owner's interest to a tenancy in common while the remaining original owners may continue as joint tenants among themselves.

---

## Question 5
Which form of ownership provides the greatest protection from creditors of one spouse?
A. Joint Tenancy
B. Tenancy in Common
C. Tenancy by the Entireties
D. Tenancy in Severalty

**Correct Answer:** C. Tenancy by the Entireties

**Explanation:** In New Jersey, tenancy by the entireties protects property from creditors of only one spouse. Creditors must have a judgment against both spouses to attach the property.

---

## Question 6
A person who owns property alone, without any other co-owners, holds title as:
A. Sole proprietor
B. Tenant in common
C. Tenant in severalty
D. Individual tenant

**Correct Answer:** C. Tenant in severalty

**Explanation:** Tenancy in severalty (also called sole ownership or ownership in severalty) means one person owns the property alone, "severed" from others.

---

## Question 7
Upon divorce, a tenancy by the entireties automatically becomes:
A. Joint tenancy
B. Tenancy in common
C. Community property
D. Separate property

**Correct Answer:** B. Tenancy in common

**Explanation:** Since tenancy by the entireties requires the parties to be married, divorce automatically converts the ownership to tenancy in common, with each former spouse typically holding a 50% interest.

---

## Question 8
Which type of co-ownership does NOT require equal ownership interests?
A. Joint Tenancy
B. Tenancy by the Entireties
C. Tenancy in Common
D. All require equal interests

**Correct Answer:** C. Tenancy in Common

**Explanation:** Tenants in common may hold unequal interests (e.g., one owner with 60%, another with 40%). Joint tenancy and tenancy by the entireties both require equal interests.

---

## Question 9
If a joint tenant dies, their interest in the property:
A. Passes to their heirs according to their will
B. Is distributed according to intestate succession laws
C. Automatically transfers to the surviving joint tenant(s)
D. Becomes part of the probate estate

**Correct Answer:** C. Automatically transfers to the surviving joint tenant(s)

**Explanation:** The right of survivorship in joint tenancy means the deceased's interest automatically passes to surviving joint tenants, bypassing the will and probate process.

---

## Question 10
Two unmarried individuals who wish to own property together with the right of survivorship should take title as:
A. Tenants in common
B. Joint tenants
C. Tenants by the entireties
D. Community property owners

**Correct Answer:** B. Joint tenants

**Explanation:** Joint tenancy provides the right of survivorship and is available to any parties, married or unmarried. Tenancy by the entireties is only available to married couples in New Jersey.


# Practice Questions: Ownership Types (NJ Real Estate Exam)

## Question 1
Maria and Jose, a married couple in New Jersey, are purchasing their first home together. Their attorney recommends a form of ownership that will provide them with the right of survivorship and also protect their property from creditors if only one spouse has a judgment against them. Additionally, this form of ownership requires both spouses to sign any deed or mortgage. Which form of ownership is the attorney most likely recommending?

A. Joint Tenancy
B. Tenancy in Common
C. Tenancy by the Entireties
D. Tenancy in Severalty

**Correct Answer:** C. Tenancy by the Entireties

**Explanation:** Tenancy by the entireties is a special form of joint ownership available only to married couples in New Jersey. It includes the right of survivorship and provides creditor protection - creditors of only one spouse cannot attach or force the sale of property held as tenants by the entireties. Both spouses must consent to any transfer or encumbrance of the property. This form of ownership treats the married couple as a single legal entity.

---

## Question 2
Four friends purchase an investment property together. Alex contributes 40% of the purchase price, Taylor contributes 30%, Jordan contributes 20%, and Casey contributes 10%. Each friend wants their ownership interest to reflect their actual financial contribution, and they want the ability to sell or transfer their individual shares without needing permission from the others. If one of them dies, they want their share to pass to their own heirs rather than to the other co-owners. What type of ownership should they establish?

A. Joint Tenancy with unequal shares
B. Tenancy in Common
C. Tenancy by the Entireties
D. Partnership in Severalty

**Correct Answer:** B. Tenancy in Common

**Explanation:** Tenancy in common is the only form of co-ownership that allows for unequal ownership interests and permits each owner to independently sell, transfer, or mortgage their share without the consent of other owners. There is no right of survivorship in a tenancy in common, so when an owner dies, their interest passes to their heirs through their will or intestate succession, not to the co-owners. This arrangement provides the flexibility these investors need while respecting their different contribution levels.

## Question 3
Sarah and Michael purchased a vacation home together ten years ago as joint tenants. They each owned a 50% interest with the right of survivorship. Last month, Sarah decided to sell her interest in the property to her daughter, Emma, without consulting Michael. Emma received a deed for Sarah's 50% interest and recorded it at the county clerk's office. What is the current ownership status of the vacation home?

A. Emma and Michael are now joint tenants
B. Emma and Michael are now tenants in common
C. Emma owns the property in severalty because Sarah's sale was invalid
D. The property is now held as tenancy by the entireties

**Correct Answer:** B. Emma and Michael are now tenants in common

**Explanation:** When Sarah sold her joint tenancy interest to Emma, she "severed" the joint tenancy with respect to her share. This broke the unities of time and title required for joint tenancy. Emma now holds her 50% interest as a tenant in common with Michael, meaning she does not have the right of survivorship with him. However, if there were additional joint tenants beyond Sarah and Michael, those remaining original joint tenants might continue to hold their interests as joint tenants among themselves. Emma can sell her interest freely, and if she dies, her 50% will pass to her heirs, not automatically to Michael.

## Question 4
Robert and Linda were married and owned their home in New Jersey as tenants by the entireties. After 15 years of marriage, they divorced last year. The divorce decree stated that they would continue to co-own the house until their youngest child graduates from high school in three years, at which point they will sell it and split the proceeds equally. Neither Robert nor Linda has remarried. What is their current form of ownership?

A. They still hold the property as tenants by the entireties until they sell it
B. The property automatically converted to joint tenancy upon divorce
C. They now hold the property as tenants in common
D. Each spouse now holds their portion in severalty

**Correct Answer:** C. They now hold the property as tenants in common

**Explanation:** Tenancy by the entireties can only exist between a husband and wife during a valid marriage. When Robert and Linda divorced, this form of ownership automatically terminated and converted to a tenancy in common by operation of law. As tenants in common, each former spouse typically holds a 50% undivided interest in the property. They no longer have the right of survivorship - if one dies before the property is sold, their 50% interest will pass to their heirs or beneficiaries, not automatically to the ex-spouse. Each could theoretically sell their interest to a third party, though this might violate their divorce agreement. Creditors of one ex-spouse can now attach that person's individual interest in the property.

## Question 5
Three siblings - Jennifer, David, and Patricia - inherited a rental property from their father. His will specified that they should receive equal shares. Jennifer wants to ensure that if something happens to her, her share will go to her children rather than to David and Patricia. David prefers that his share eventually go to his surviving siblings rather than his own estranged children. Patricia wants the flexibility to sell her share if she needs money for a medical emergency. Their attorney explains that they need to decide how to hold title. Given these different preferences, what should the attorney recommend?

A. They should all take title as joint tenants, but Jennifer and Patricia can later change their interests to tenancy in common
B. They should take title as tenants by the entireties since they're family members
C. They should all take title as tenants in common, and David can later deed his interest to his siblings
D. They must all agree on either joint tenancy or tenancy in common for all three siblings

**Correct Answer:** A. They should all take title as joint tenants, but Jennifer and Patricia can later change their interests to tenancy in common

**Explanation:** This situation can be solved through strategic use of different ownership forms. Initially, all three can take title as joint tenants, which gives David the right of survivorship he desires. Jennifer and Patricia can then each individually sever their joint tenancy interests by deeding their shares to themselves as tenants in common, while David remains as a joint tenant. This creates a hybrid situation: Jennifer and Patricia would each hold their interests as tenants in common (without survivorship rights, allowing them to pass property to their heirs and sell freely), while David maintains his joint tenancy with the right of survivorship. When Jennifer or Patricia dies, their share passes to their heirs. When David dies, his share would pass to the surviving tenant(s) through the joint tenancy right of survivorship. This arrangement respects all three siblings' wishes.

## Question 6
A real estate investor owns six different residential properties in New Jersey. Five of the properties she owns by herself with no co-owners. The sixth property she owns with two business partners as tenants in common, holding a 50% interest while each partner holds 25%. For the property where she has no co-owners, what type of ownership does she have?

A. Sole proprietorship
B. Joint tenancy
C. Tenancy in severalty
D. Individual proprietorship

**Correct Answer:** C. Tenancy in severalty

**Explanation:** Tenancy in severalty (also called sole ownership or estate in severalty) exists when one person owns property alone, without any co-owners. The term comes from the word "sever," meaning the owner's interest is severed or separated from all others. Despite the plural-sounding name, this refers to individual ownership. For the five properties she owns alone, the investor holds them in severalty. This gives her complete control over those properties - she can sell, mortgage, lease, or transfer them without needing anyone else's consent. If she dies, those properties will pass according to her will or, if she has no will, according to New Jersey's intestate succession laws. The sixth property, where she co-owns with partners as tenants in common, is not held in severalty because there are multiple owners.

## Question 7
Thomas and William are brothers who purchased an investment property together five years ago. They took title as joint tenants and each contributed equally to the purchase. Last week, Thomas was sued by a creditor who obtained a judgment against him for $75,000. The creditor has filed a lien against Thomas's interest in the investment property. William is concerned about losing the property. He contacts his attorney to ask what happens now and whether the joint tenancy is affected by his brother's debt.

A. The creditor can force the sale of the entire property and take Thomas's half of the proceeds
B. The creditor's lien automatically severs the joint tenancy, converting both interests to tenancy in common
C. The creditor can only place a lien on Thomas's interest; if Thomas dies first, the lien disappears as William receives the property through right of survivorship
D. The creditor must wait until the property is sold by the brothers before collecting from Thomas's share

**Correct Answer:** C. The creditor can only place a lien on Thomas's interest; if Thomas dies first, the lien disappears as William receives the property through right of survivorship

**Explanation:** In a joint tenancy, a creditor of one joint tenant can place a lien on that tenant's interest, but this action alone does not sever the joint tenancy in most jurisdictions. The right of survivorship remains intact. This creates an interesting situation: if Thomas dies before the creditor forces a sale or partition, his interest automatically passes to William through the right of survivorship, and the creditor's lien is extinguished because Thomas no longer has any interest to attach. However, if the creditor forces a partition sale or if Thomas sells his interest before dying, the joint tenancy would be severed at that point. The creditor cannot force the sale of William's interest, only Thomas's share. This demonstrates one limitation of joint tenancy as creditor protection compared to tenancy by the entireties.

## Question 8
Rebecca and Steven, an unmarried couple, purchased a condo together three years ago. They took title as joint tenants because they wanted the right of survivorship. Last year, Rebecca married her partner Alex, but Steven remained unmarried and continued living in the condo with Rebecca and Alex. Rebecca now wants to change the ownership structure so that if she dies, her interest goes to her spouse Alex rather than to Steven. What must Rebecca do to accomplish this goal?

A. Simply execute a new will leaving her interest to Alex, which will override the joint tenancy
B. Record an affidavit declaring her intent to change the survivorship rights
C. Sever the joint tenancy by conveying her interest to herself as a tenant in common, then devise it to Alex in her will
D. Convert the ownership to tenancy by the entireties between all three parties

**Correct Answer:** C. Sever the joint tenancy by conveying her interest to herself as a tenant in common, then devise it to Alex in her will

**Explanation:** The right of survivorship in a joint tenancy automatically transfers property outside of the probate system and supersedes any contrary provisions in a will. Therefore, a will alone cannot override the joint tenancy structure. To accomplish her goal, Rebecca must first sever the joint tenancy with respect to her interest. She can do this by executing and recording a deed from herself as a joint tenant to herself as a tenant in common (many states, including New Jersey, allow this). This converts her 50% interest to a tenancy in common while Steven retains his interest. Once her interest is held as a tenant in common, there is no right of survivorship, and she can then use her will to leave her 50% interest to Alex. Tenancy by the entireties is only available to married couples and cannot include three parties, so option D is not possible.

## Question 9
Margaret owns a commercial building in Newark. She is the sole owner and holds title in severalty. She is considering bringing in two investors, Franklin and Grace, who will each contribute capital for renovations. Margaret wants to maintain control of the property and ensure that she retains a 60% ownership interest, while Franklin and Grace would each receive 20%. Additionally, Margaret wants to ensure that if either Franklin or Grace dies, their interest goes to their own families rather than increasing her ownership share. What form of ownership should Margaret establish?

A. Convert to joint tenancy with unequal shares
B. Convert to tenancy in common with specified percentage interests
C. Establish tenancy by the entireties among all three parties
D. Maintain tenancy in severalty and give Franklin and Grace profit-sharing agreements instead

**Correct Answer:** B. Convert to tenancy in common with specified percentage interests

**Explanation:** Tenancy in common is the only form of co-ownership that allows for unequal ownership interests. Margaret can hold 60% while Franklin and Grace each hold 20%. The deed should clearly specify these percentage interests. Tenancy in common does not include the right of survivorship, which aligns with Margaret's desire that Franklin and Grace's interests pass to their families upon death rather than to the surviving co-owners. Each tenant in common can freely sell, transfer, or mortgage their individual interest without the consent of the other owners. Joint tenancy would not work because it requires equal interests and includes the right of survivorship. Tenancy by the entireties is only available to married couples. Option D would not give Franklin and Grace actual ownership interests in the property.

## Question 10
Edward and Elizabeth, a married couple, own their home in New Jersey as tenants by the entireties. Edward owns a small business that recently failed, resulting in $200,000 in business debt. His creditors have obtained judgments against Edward personally. Meanwhile, Elizabeth has no debts. The creditors are now seeking to force the sale of the couple's home to satisfy Edward's debts. Edward and Elizabeth contact an attorney to understand their rights. What should the attorney tell them about the creditors' ability to attach their home?

A. The creditors can force the sale of the home because Edward has an ownership interest
B. The creditors can place a lien on Edward's 50% interest only, but cannot force a sale while the marriage continues
C. The creditors cannot attach the property at all while it is held as tenancy by the entireties and Elizabeth has no liability for the debt
D. The tenancy by the entireties automatically converts to tenancy in common when one spouse has a judgment against them, making Edward's share attachable

**Correct Answer:** C. The creditors cannot attach the property at all while it is held as tenancy by the entireties and Elizabeth has no liability for the debt

**Explanation:** One of the most important features of tenancy by the entireties in New Jersey is creditor protection. Property held as tenancy by the entireties cannot be reached by creditors of only one spouse. Since Elizabeth is not liable for Edward's business debts, the creditors cannot force the sale of the home, place a lien on it, or attach any interest in it. This is because tenancy by the entireties treats the married couple as a single legal unit - neither spouse individually owns a separate divisible share that can be attached. The creditors would need a judgment against both Edward and Elizabeth to reach the property. This protection continues as long as the couple remains married and holds the property as tenants by the entireties. If they divorce, the property would automatically convert to tenancy in common, and at that point, Edward's creditors could attach his individual interest.
