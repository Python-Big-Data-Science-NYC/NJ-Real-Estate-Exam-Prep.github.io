# New Jersey Real Estate: Property Ownership & Interests Practice Questions

## 🏢 Corporate & Entity Ownership

### Question 1
**A corporation takes title to real property through a:**
- A) Tenancy in severalty
- B) Joint tenancy
- C) Tenancy at will
- D) A corporation may not take title to real property

**Answer: A**  
**Detailed Explanation:** A corporation is considered an "artificial person" under the law. When it owns property alone (not with others), it holds title in **severalty** (meaning "severed" or separate from others). This is the correct form of sole ownership for legal entities like corporations, LLCs, and trusts.

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **B) Joint tenancy:** Requires the "four unities" (time, title, interest, possession) and right of survivorship. A corporation cannot hold joint tenancy because it lacks mortality and cannot meet the "time" unity (acquiring interest simultaneously with others).
- **C) Tenancy at will:** This is a type of leasehold estate, not ownership.
- **D) A corporation may not take title:** False - corporations can own real property in all states.

**NJ Specific Note:** In New Jersey, corporations, LLCs, partnerships, and trusts can all hold title to real property, each with different implications for liability and transfer.

### Question 2
**A limited liability company (LLC) owns a commercial building. How is this title held?**
- A) Tenancy in common
- B) Tenancy in severalty
- C) Joint tenancy
- D) Partnership tenancy

**Answer: B**  
**Explanation:** An LLC, like a corporation, is a separate legal entity. When it owns property alone, it holds in **severalty**. The LLC members do not directly own the property; they own interests in the LLC.

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **A) Tenancy in common:** This would apply if the LLC co-owned with another entity.
- **C) Joint tenancy:** Not available to entities.
- **D) Partnership tenancy:** Not a recognized form; partnerships hold title as specified in partnership agreement.

## 🏠 Condos, Co-ops & Timeshares

### Question 3
**Ann lives in the upscale Richman Tower. She holds a proprietary lease as evidence of ownership. What does she own?**
- A) Condominium unit
- B) Leasehold estate
- C) Shares in a co-op corporation
- D) A week in a timeshare

**Answer: C**  
**Detailed Explanation:** A **proprietary lease** is the key indicator of cooperative (co-op) ownership. In a co-op:
- Buyers purchase shares in the cooperative corporation
- Shares entitle them to a proprietary lease for a specific unit
- They don't own real property directly; they own personal property (shares)
- Monthly payments cover maintenance, taxes, and mortgage on the entire building

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **A) Condominium unit:** Condo owners receive a deed to their unit + undivided interest in common elements.
- **B) Leasehold estate:** This refers to a tenant's rights, not ownership.
- **D) Timeshare:** Timeshares involve interval ownership, not proprietary leases for full-time residence.

**NJ Note:** Co-ops are less common in NJ than condos but exist, especially in older buildings in Hudson County and Jersey City.

### Question 4
**What would MOST likely stipulate the color of exterior decorative lights a condo owner can use?**
- A) CC&Rs
- B) Condominium bylaws
- C) Horizontal property acts
- D) Owners association

**Answer: A**  
**Detailed Explanation:** **CC&Rs** (Covenants, Conditions & Restrictions) are the governing documents that regulate aesthetics, maintenance, and use. They typically cover:
- Exterior paint colors
- Landscaping
- Decorative elements (lights, flags, holiday decorations)
- Architectural modifications

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **B) Condominium bylaws:** Govern administration (meetings, elections, budgets), not specific aesthetic rules.
- **C) Horizontal property acts:** State laws enabling condo creation, not operational rules.
- **D) Owners association:** The entity that enforces rules, not the document containing them.

**NJ Specific:** NJ Condominium Act allows associations to adopt reasonable rules affecting unit exteriors to maintain uniformity and property values.

### Question 5
**A timeshare owner at a Jersey Shore resort has the right to use unit #205 every third week in July. What type of timeshare is this?**
- A) Fee simple
- B) Right-to-use
- C) Fixed week
- D) Floating time

**Answer: C**  
**Explanation:** **Fixed week** timeshares assign specific weeks annually. The owner has use rights for that exact week each year.

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **A) Fee simple:** Ownership of real property; rare in timeshares.
- **B) Right-to-use:** Leasehold interest for a set term (e.g., 20 years).
- **D) Floating time:** Use during a season but not specific weeks.

**NJ Regulation:** Timeshares in NJ are regulated under the Real Estate Timeshare Act, requiring specific disclosures and cooling-off periods.

## 👥 Marital & Joint Ownership

### Question 6
**Josh and Reva, husband and wife, own their home as tenants by the entirety. When Josh dies, Reva automatically becomes sole owner. What type of property ownership has this become?**
- A) Ownership in severalty
- B) Statutory life estate
- C) Statutory survivorship tenancy
- D) Tenancy in common

**Answer: A**  
**Detailed Explanation:** **Tenancy by the entirety** is a special form of joint ownership available ONLY to married couples in some states (including NJ). Features:
- Right of survivorship
- Cannot be severed by one spouse alone
- Creditors of one spouse cannot attach the property

When one spouse dies, the survivor holds title **in severalty** (alone).

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **B) Statutory life estate:** Created by law (e.g., dower/curtesy, now abolished in NJ).
- **C) Statutory survivorship tenancy:** Not a recognized term; survivorship is a feature, not a tenancy type.
- **D) Tenancy in common:** No right of survivorship; heirs inherit, not spouse automatically.

**NJ Note:** NJ recognizes tenancy by the entirety for both real and personal property for married couples.

### Question 7
**Three siblings inherit a house from their parents. They take title as tenants in common. One sibling sells her interest to a friend. What is the ownership structure now?**
- A) Joint tenancy between the two remaining siblings
- B) Tenancy in common between two siblings and the friend
- C) Tenancy by the entirety for the siblings
- D) Severally for the friend

**Answer: B**  
**Explanation:** Tenancy in common allows unequal shares and free transfer. When one tenant sells, the new owner becomes a tenant in common with the others. No right of survivorship exists.

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **A) Joint tenancy:** Would require the "four unities" and agreement to create.
- **C) Tenancy by the entirety:** Only for married couples.
- **D) Severally:** The friend owns only 1/3 interest, not the whole.

---

### Question 8
**To create a joint tenancy in New Jersey, what is required?**
- A) A deed stating "as joint tenants"
- B) A will specifying joint tenancy
- C) Automatic for married couples
- D) Recording with county clerk

**Answer: A**  
**Explanation:** NJ requires **clear language** in the deed like "as joint tenants with right of survivorship" or similar. Without this, grantees take as tenants in common.

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **B) A will:** Transfers property after death, doesn't create joint tenancy during life.
- **C) Automatic:** Never automatic; requires specific intent.
- **D) Recording:** Necessary for validity but doesn't create the tenancy type.

## 🏛️ Trusts & Life Estates

### Question 9
**A grandmother deeds her house to her granddaughter but reserves the right to live there until her death. The granddaughter receives what?**
- A) Fee simple absolute
- B) Future interest
- C) Life estate pur autre vie
- D) Leasehold estate

**Answer: B**  
**Explanation:** The granddaughter receives a **future interest** (remainder interest) that becomes possessory upon the grandmother's death. The grandmother keeps a **life estate**.

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **A) Fee simple:** Would give immediate full ownership.
- **C) Life estate pur autre vie:** Life estate measured by another's life.
- **D) Leasehold:** Temporary right from landlord, not ownership.

---

### Question 10
**A living trust in New Jersey holds title to residential property. Who has legal title?**
- A) The grantor
- B) The trustee
- C) The beneficiaries
- D) The trust itself

**Answer: B**  
**Explanation:** The **trustee** holds legal title to trust property. The beneficiaries hold equitable title (right to benefit).

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **A) Grantor:** Transfers title to trustee when creating trust.
- **C) Beneficiaries:** Have beneficial interest, not legal title.
- **D) Trust itself:** A trust isn't a legal entity that can hold title in NJ.

## 📊 Complex Ownership Scenarios

### Question 11
**Four friends buy a vacation home. Three want joint tenancy; one wants tenancy in common. How will title be held?**
- A) All as tenants in common
- B) All as joint tenants
- C) Three as joint tenants, one as tenant in common
- D) Cannot mix tenancy types

**Answer: D**  
**Explanation:** All co-owners must hold under the **same tenancy**. Joint tenancy requires the "four unities" for all owners. Mixed tenancies create tenancy in common for all.

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **A, B, C:** Not possible due to unity requirements.

### Question 12
**An unmarried couple buys a house in New Jersey. The deed says "to A and B." How do they hold title?**
- A) Joint tenancy
- B) Tenancy in common
- C) Tenancy by the entirety
- D) Determined by their agreement

**Answer: B**  
**Explanation:** NJ presumes **tenancy in common** unless deed explicitly states "joint tenants with right of survivorship." Unmarried couples cannot hold as tenants by the entirety.

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **A) Joint tenancy:** Requires specific language.
- **C) Tenancy by the entirety:** Only for married couples.
- **D) Agreement:** Not controlling; deed language controls.

---

**A NJ homeowner dies intestate (no will), survived by spouse and two children. The spouse receives:**
- A) 100% of the house if held as tenants by the entirety
- B) 1/3 interest as tenant in common
- C) Life estate in entire property
- D) Depends on how title was held

**Answer: D**  
**Explanation:** Depends entirely on how title was held:
- Tenancy by entirety: Spouse gets 100% by survivorship
- Joint tenancy with right of survivorship: Same
- Tenancy in common: Spouse gets share plus intestate share of deceased's portion
- Severalty: Spouse gets share under intestacy laws

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **A, B, C:** May be true in specific cases but not universally.

## 🔍 Exam Tips

1. **Look for keywords:**
   - "Proprietary lease" = co-op
   - "Undivided interest" = condo/common elements
   - "With right of survivorship" = joint tenancy or tenancy by entirety
   - "As joint tenants" = must specify in NJ

2. **Marital property:** NJ is NOT a community property state

3. **Entity ownership:** Corporations/LLCs hold in severalty

4. **Inheritance:** Always check how title was held first

5. **Condos vs. Co-ops:**
   - Condo: Deed to unit + common elements
   - Co-op: Stock certificate + proprietary lease
