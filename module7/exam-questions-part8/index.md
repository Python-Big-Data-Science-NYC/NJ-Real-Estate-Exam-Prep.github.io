B) MLS requires accurate commission offers

Broker Kim represents Seller Smith. Buyer Johnson comes to open house without representation. During showing, Johnson reveals: "I can go to $550,000 but start at $525,000" and "I need to sell my condo first." Kim doesn't disclose this to Smith. Later, Johnson's offer at $525,000 is accepted.

B) Duty of confidentiality to Johnson  
C) Duty of loyalty to Smith  
D) Both B and C
